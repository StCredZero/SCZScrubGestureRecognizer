SCZScrubGestureRecognizer
=========================

Implements a "scrubbing" gesture, that's not necessarily scrolling. (Like scrubbing an audio/video track.) You can hack scrolling events and use the existing scrolling gesture recognizer, but this strikes me as too clever by being too confusing.

This project includes a simple demo app. Simply include the SCZScrubGestureRecognizer.h and SCZScrubGestureRecognizer.m files. Same code for use is in the SCZViewController.m file.
